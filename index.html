                <p>&emsp;Hi! I'm Jordan. I am a Junior Web Developer and have just graduated with my Master's in Buddhist Studies.
                    I am an impassioned learner, I just can't stop trying to learn something new, to develop new skills, and find ways to express my imagination.
                    Web Design is a perfect outlet for such creativity, and I am excited about my exploration and development of a Web Design skillset.
                </p>
